# Yucibot
*A multipurpose Twitch bot and website*

[Installation guide](https://github.com/Mstiekema/Yucibot/wiki/Installation-guide)  
[Example website](http://www.yucibot.nl)  
*An official website is coming soon.*

I created Yucibot as a fun project after being inspired by pajbot and other Twitch bots. I saw that a lot of bots lacked features, so I wanted to make something uses all the tools a streamer needs. They also shouldn't have more than one bot, so it also has all the normal features a normal chatbot has. You can always turn off features that you do not want to use

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Here are a few examples of the current features
<ul>
  <li>Custom commands</li>
  <li>Point and profile system</li>
  <li>Chat mini-games</li>
  <li>Moderation tools</li>
  <li>Songrequest</li>
  <li>Chat logger</li>
</ul>

If you have any suggestions for new features, just [open up a new issue](https://github.com/Mstiekema/Yucibot/issues).
