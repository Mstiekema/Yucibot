# Yucibot
*A multipurpose Twitch bot and website*

[Installation guide](https://github.com/Mstiekema/Yucibot/wiki/Installation-guide)

Yucibot is a project created and managed by Mstiekema. I created this bot as a fun project after being inspired by pajbot and other Twitch bots.
<br>
I saw that a lot of bots lacked some features. With this project, I want to create a bot that has everything that a streamer needs. It should have a songlist, polling system, point system and a lot more! I also started this project so I could learn some coding. The project itself is written in JavaScript / node.js.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The bot has multiple features. At the moment the bot has these features:
<ul>
  <li>Multiple fun and useful commands</li>
  <li>Point and profile system</li>
  <li>Point games</li>
  <li>Moderation tools</li>
  <li>Songrequest</li>
  <li>Chat logger</li>
  <li>Top 5 clips</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>I plan to improve the bot a whole lot in the future. I can't do this alone, so if you have suggestion please submit an issue on the <a href="https://www.github.com/Mstiekema/Yucibot">
GitHub</a> page.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Working on this bot takes up a whole lot of my time. If you, as a viewer, want to support me, the developer of the bot, you can do that down below. Support of course isn't required, but always appreciated! If you donate, I'll add you to the "special" donator list down below.</p>
